# Kata Starter Toolkit

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/APCOvernight/kata-starter-tookit.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is the barebones set up for practicing code katas in javascript with Mocha and Chai. It makes it quick and easy to start a new session without worrying about the scaffolding.

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- NPM (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/))

## Getting started

`npm install` or `yarn` - Install dependencies

## File structure

- `src/` Put code in here
- `test/` Put tests in here

## Run tests

- `npm test` - Run tests once
- `npm run watch` - Run tests when any js file changes

## Tools

- Tests are run with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and organised using the [BDD interface](https://mochajs.org/#bdd)
- Test assertions are written with [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and the [BDD/Expect style](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
